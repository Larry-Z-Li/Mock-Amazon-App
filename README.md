README file for hw2

Amazon.cpp contains main(), the core of the code.
Main() takes in two parameters, int argc, char* argv[], of which index 1 of argv will be read for the database file, containing users and products. argc must then have a value of 2 or more for the application to proceed.
Products and users must be formatted accordingly to the example database.txt included, with product and user sections. Books, Movies, and Clothing items have special variables that will be parsed accordingly.
It is recommended write a new main() function, then changing the existing main function to a different name so to more conveniently feed it its needed parameters.
